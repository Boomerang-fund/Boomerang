        <p>
            Introduce your creative idea to the world. Set a funding goal and
            choose a campaign duration between 1 and 90 days. Offer unique
            rewards that backers will receive when your project comes to life.

        <p>
            Reach out to friends, family, and fans to support your journey.
            Boomerang's all-or-nothing funding model ensures you have the
            necessary resources to realize your vision. A simple 5% fee applies
            only if your project is successfully funded.
